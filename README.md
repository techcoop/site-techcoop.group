# Techcoop.group - Public website

## Table of Contents

## Requirements
* node `^4.5.0`
* yarn `^0.17.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

## Install

Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/techcoop/techcoop.group.git techcoop.group
$ cd techcoop.group
```

Install dependencies and check to see it works.
It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic installs, but `npm install` will work just as well.

```bash
$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start      # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
```

You should now have a server running on http://localhost:3000
